ANNIHILATION
One way in. No way out. You play as Lena, cellular biology professor and former U.S. Army soldier. Near the US government's Area X facility lies the Shimmer, which emerged three years ago when a meteor  landed in a lighthouse nearby, and is gradually expanding and increasing its boundaries. Many expeditions have been organized, but only your husband Kane returns home after a year of absence. Kane is glazed and distant, and his condition quickly deteriorates. As Kane is put in intensive care, psychologist Dr. Ventress prepares a new expedition into the Shimmer, which you volunteer for. Three other women participate in the expedition: physicist Josie Radek, geomorphologist Cassie "Cass" Sheppard, and paramedic Anya Thorensen.

THE DAY AFTER KANE IS IN AN INDUCED COLD-COMA
The door unlocks, revealing a woman in her late forties. This is Dr Ventress. Glasses. Suit. Smiling. She's holding a small plastic bottle of mineral water.
'Hello.'
The door locks behind her.
'Would you like some water?'

DR VENTRESS SEEMS PLEASED.
'When did Sergeant Kane arrive home?'
'I think it was yesterday.'
'Had he contacted you at any point over the last few months?'
'No. The last I heard from him was when he left on his mission, until he reappeared.'
'But you made regular requests for information about him to his unit CO, until six months ago. Then you stopped. Why was that?'
'Because we had an agreement. Between us. Six months of radio silence meant I was to assume he was dead. And move on.'
Dr Ventress gives a sympathetic nod.
'It's not easy to move on.' 
'I didn't.'
Silence.
You sit back in your chair.

Choices:
1. 'Where is Kane?' > 5
2. 'Where am I?' > 6

DR VENTRESS GIVES A PERFUNCTORY SMILE.
'When did Sergeant Kane arrive home?'
'That depends how long I've been here.'
Dr Ventress says nothing.
'I think it was yesterday.'
'He didn't tell you what he was doing. Or where he was going.
'He never did. I never asked. He just disappeared for a year.'
'But you made regular requests for information about him to his unit CO, until six months ago. Then you stopped. Why was that?'

THE SOUTHERN REACH - DAY
'Your husband is in the same building as you. And I should tell you, he's extremely ill.
You catch your breath.
'Ill in what way?'
'We don't actually know. He doesn't test positive for any known condition - but, objectively, his body is hemorrhaging and his organs are failing.
'He's dying.'
'Yes,' Dr Ventress stands up, 'come with me'.
You walk down a corridor towards the elevator lobby. There are rows of windowless rooms, tiled walls and floors. A military feel, or prison. The elevator brings you up to the mess hall of the facility. It is packed with soldiers, scientists and administrative staff. They sit at tables, chatting. On the far side of the room, there is a floor to ceiling glass wall, through which for the first time in the facility we see daylight. Bright, burnished, gold. In the middle of the wall is an open double door, leading to the outside. You make only five or six steps into the sunlight. You stop. Arrested by the view in front of you. You realize you're standing on a viewing platform, essentially a massive balcony, which projects from the hall, three stories above the ground. And the facility you were held in turns out to be some kind of gatehouse structure - like a medieval castle, dragged into a brutalist twenty first century. Either side of the facility, a concrete wall extends. Massive, buttressed, punctuated with watch towers. It looks designed to contain or defend against something mythic in scale. 
This would be a stunning sight in its own right - but it's the view from the platform that stopped you in your tracks. It shows a landscape, behind which the sun sets. A stretch of bare ground, for a few hundred yards beyond the concrete wall, leading to a dense forest. And in front of - or permeating - the forest, there is a shimmer. Similar to a heat haze - it gives a glassy liquid quality to everything seen through its prism. But unlike a heat haze - and like a prism - it splits light. So, through the shimmer - the sun distorts into a deliquescing orange orb, fringed with chromatic aberrations of blue and green. The colours on the clouds split into a full rainbow spectrum, spread across the sky like psychedelic Northern Lights. The trees in the forest distort gently, as if pushed by a gentle wind that eases the trunks into movement, as if they were as light as leaves.
'Northern Florida. Thirty miles from the coast. It was the Blackwater State Park, but we now call it the Southern Reach.'
'Why is a National Park sealed behind a fifty metre high concrete wall?'
'Thirteen years ago, a park guide reported an event to the local police. A lighthouse on the coast was surrounded by what he called a 'shimmer'. A friend of his had entered to find out what was going on - and never returned. We evacuated the area and concocted a cover story - an accident on a cargo ship, carrying nuclear waste. Then we set up a covert body to investigate the phenomena. And three hundred billion dollars later, we know nothing more than was contained in that first brief police report.'
Behind the doctor, the landscape undulates and refracts.
'Something goes in, and it doesn't come back. And I'm not just talking about people. Drones, robots, animals, birds, radio waves, radar, particle streams. It's a black hole. Nothing gets out.'
'Yet Kane did.'
'Is he the same Kane?'
You ignore that question.
'You have no idea what it is?
'We have many. An extra-terrestrial event; a multi-dimensional event; a religious event. The ideas are endless. What we lack are facts.'
You join Dr Ventress at the map. She indicates the border of the shimmer. Concentric circles - like tree rings - dated by year.
'Area 'X'. The only thing we can say for certain is that it's getting bigger. Initially, it enclosed the lighthouse and an area of about fifty square metres. It now covers an area the size of Chicago.'
You look at the dated bands, the expanding gap between the most recent circles.
'The expansion rate is increasing.'
'Exponentially. In five years, the Shimmer will encompass the Southern United States and most of Mexico.'
'And in ten years?'
'The planet.'
'And you're going to let it happen?'
'Southern Reach has failed in its objectives, and I'm about to be relieved of command. Before that happens, I've authorised a final mission into Area X. And this time, I'm going to lead it.'
'When do you leave?'
'Tomorrow morning.'

SOUTHERN REACH FACILITY/FIRING RANGE - DAY
A woman is firing an automatic rifle. Her name is Anya Thorensen. She's a handsome woman in her mid-thirties. Close-cropped hair, wearing a white vest that shows muscled arms. Obviously lifts weights. She has a very distinctive TATTOO encircling her forearm, depicting an ouroboros - a snake eating its tail.
In the next alley, Cass Sheppard fires at a target. The bullet holes are loosely grouped, but they find their mark. She's in her mid-forties. Glasses, pony-tail efficiently tied back. Could be a mother at school gates, if not for the automatic rifle.
Beside Sheppard, a random spray of rounds hit various places, but not the target. Josie Radek is in her mid-twenties, but feels younger. She has the sheltered quality that people have when they've passed straight from school to college to doctorate. She's having trouble with her weapon. She looks frightened by the recoil, leaning her face away from the stock, and convulsively screwing her eyes as the gun continues firing.
You step up to the fourth alley in the firing range, lifting a rifle and squeezing the trigger. You keep the gun steady, firing in neat three round bursts with the stock pushed tight up against your cheek bone. A neat group of rounds appears in the middle of the target.
Dr Ventress shifts her gaze to Thorensen, Sheppard, and Radek - who are clearly surprised to find this new person in the fourth firing alley. You empty the last rounds in your clip. The final volley of gunshots leaves a ringing echo in the concrete chamber. Broken by Dr Ventress.
'Team.'
The women remove their ear defenders.
'I'd like to introduce Lena Kerans, a biologist we have sequestered from Johns Hopkins, to join us on the mission to the lighthouse. Ms Kerans, meet Anya Thorensen, a medic. Cass Sheppard, a geologist. And Josie Radek, a physicist.

SOUTHERN REACH FACILITY/MESS HALL - DAY
'Have you all been at the facility a long time?'
Thorensen is the first to warm up to you. 
'Nearly a year now. I was a paramedic in Chicago. Tried to join MSF, thinking I'd work out in Asia or something. But my application got flagged by some computer system, and Southern Reach got in touch. That chime with how they got to you?'
'Yeah. Similar story.'
You nod towards the Shimmer.
'Do you ever get used to the view?'
Sheppard laughs.
'It's weird. The Shimmer is the strangest thing I've ever seen. Like - what's the Grand Canyon to this? But at the same time, you do kind of get used to it. You have to accept it, because it's there.'
'I have a question.'
'Shoot.'
'Why's the team all women?'
'Affirmative action. It's an important part of the struggle that women get equal opportunity to go on suicide missions.'
Radek speaks up for the first time. 'It's also because they think a team of women might have a better chance of survival than a team that includes men.' She goes quiet again.
'I don't follow.'
'There're two theories about what goes wrong inside Area X. One: something in there kills them. Two: they kill each other. Theory one favours a male team, all big and butch, armed to the teeth. Theory two favours a female team. Less propensity to violence. And so far, the male teams have been shit out of luck.'
'They really think the previous expeditions might have killed each other?'
'It's a little more than they just 'think' it. Yo    u know there's a guy who made it back? The only one. They've got him in an induced coma in the med center.'
'... I did hear that.'
'So technically he wasn't the first to walk out of Area X. He was the second.'
You frown. 'The second?'
Thorensen hands you her binoculars, then gestures out across the deforested area towards the tree line.
'Check your ten o'clock, about twenty metres from the tree line.'
You raise the binoculars and look where she has indicated. You see a bundle of rags and white bone. At this distance, the bleached dome of skull is the only thing that allow us to understand it was a human.
'See the bones?'
'Yes.'
'He's been laid there about six months now. Too far away to positively ID, but from his uniform, they know he was on the previous mission.'

THE DAY OF THE EXPEDITION
The massive metal gates of the facility unlock and swing open, revealing the team, each carrying your backpacks and automatic rifles. Ahead of you is the dusty scrubland of the deforested area.
A pause.
Then Dr Ventress starts walking. Behind, the gates swing shut. The team walk in single file behind Dr Ventress. Thorensen, then Sheppard, then Radek, then you. 
You walk right past the body that Thorensen pointed out. As you pass it, you pause. You look at the skull, the way patches of hair and dried skin still cling to the underside of the skull, where it has been shielded from the wind and sun. You see the missing section of bone above the left eye socket, blown out by a bullet. You see the curve of ribs, visible where the material of the uniform has started to disintegrate.
Ahead, Dr Ventress has reached the treeline.
She  stops before entering the forest. Then she turns, to look back at you. You lock eyes through the shimmering air.

CAMP - DAY
You wake with a jolt. Wearing a T-shirt and underwear. Looking around, you realize you're surrounded by bright orange. You take a moment to understand you're inside a tent. You unzip the front flap of her tent and climb out - to discover a campsite. Five small tents, circled around a burned out fire. The campsite is positioned in a grassy clearing, deep inside a forest. The surrounding trees are Oak and Cyprus. Looking up, the sun and clouds are seen through the familiar mirage-like distortion - as if the Shimmer is like a dome structure, which we are now inside. Just in front of you, Thorensen and Sheppard sit surrounded by packets of food. A little distance away, Radek is looking at a piece of electronic equipment. Dr Ventress is nowhere to be seen.
'... What the hell?'
Thorensen and Sheppard look at you.
'Good. You're finally awake.'
'Sorry, you're going to have to give me a moment. I'm a little...thrown.'
'Join the club.'
'You don't remember setting up camp, right?'
'... I don't remember anything, after we reached the tree line.'
'None of us do. But check your boots and pants. They'll be wet and covered in mud. And we've been doing an inventory of the food. From the depletion in our stocks, we've been out here for at least forty eight hours.'
You shake your head. 'That's not possible.'
Radek walks over, looking nervous.
'Guys - you want to know what's weird?'
'I want to know what isn't weird.'
Radek pulls her short-wave radio from her belt. Gives it a burst. It plays static.
'I've been checking all my radio and electronic equipment. None of it is working properly. Like, I can switch on the sat-phone, and the GPS, and they boot up fine – but there's no signal. Even though we've probably got twenty satellites above us right now - nothing. And check this out.'
Radek holds up a magnetic compass. The needle is spinning slowly.
'It's like we're in the middle of the most massive electromagnetic interference.'
There is excitement in Radek's voice. And a note of panic.
'So we've got no compass, no comms, no coordinates, and no landmarks. We don't know where we are, or what direction we should be heading.'
Sheppard speaks up. 'Radek - be cool. We know we're in the state park. So if we go South, we hit the ocean. Once there, we can follow the shoreline until we hit the perimeter wall.
'But how do we know what's South?'
Sheppard stands and pulls up her sleeve. She shows her wristwatch.
'Take your watch. Point the hour hand at the sun. Split the difference between the hour hand and twelve.'
As she's talking, she's doing it. Having orientated the watch to the sun, she points into the forest.
'South.'
Dr Ventress raises her eyebrows. 'Very impressive.'
She shows no sense of concern about the situation. She seems almost serene.
'And honestly, Radek - we weren't really expecting the equipment to work, were we? After thirteen years of expeditions, and thirteen years of radio silence.'
She gestures at the tents.
'Let's pack up and get moving. It's already gone ten o'clock. We don't want to lose any more of the day.'

You are walking in knee-deep water. It's hot. Heavy backpacks. Heavy weapons. It's also impossible to gauge the depth of the swamp.

SWAMP - DAY
You look at the Cyprus trees with their fanned-out roots, Spanish moss on the branches, dappled sunlight through the high canopy. All reflected in the glassy water.
You turn to Radek.
'I'd like to remember it.'
Radek smiles. 'Sure. It's beautiful.'
You start walking again.
'So you're a scientist too? A physicist, right?'
'Astrophysicist. Specifically the life-cycle of stars.'
'And what is the life-cycle of stars?'
'Long.'
You laugh.
'I do the life-cycle of cells,' I said, 'short.'
Radek shrugs. 'Still a cycle.'
Up ahead, Sheppard has seen something. A structure, through the trees. She calls back to the others.
'Over here!'
On the bank of the swamp is the half-collapsed frame of a wooden hut, and a short jetty. The hut is smothered on one side by a dense carpet of brightly coloured flowers. They cover the ground and push up the side of the building like a snow drift. 
You all approach it.
Sheppard peers inside the door frame. The roof has partially fallen in. Sunlight illuminates the interior. There's a bench and a table. Some hooks on the walls. Everything metal is long corroded. Everything wooden is black and damp, and patched with moss.
'I think it's just a fishing hut.'
Back outside, you crouch by the brightly coloured flowers growing on the side of the structure. Like a sprawling bouquet, they are very varied. Some large. Some small. Some a vivid blue. Some red. Others are creamy white, with scatterings of orange-fringed crimson on the broad petals.
'... These are extremely strange flowers.'
Dr Ventress crouches down beside you. 'Why?'
'To look at them you wouldn't say they're the same species.'
You pull back an area of flowers to show the plant system beneath.
'But they're all growing from the same branch structure. So not just the same species. The same plant.'
Radek joins the both of you. 'They're like snowflakes. Each one is different. I've never seen anything like it.'
You inspect the other plants, which all seem to have the same system. 'It seems stuck in a continuous mutation. Some kind of morphogenesis error.'
Dr Ventress 'You mean it's a pathology?'
'It's very pretty, but you'd sure as hell call it a pathology if you saw it in a human.'
Radek has found something else. 'Hey, check this out.'
In the undergrowth behind the hut, there are the hulls of two upturned flat-bottomed fibreglass boats. She crouches down, and gets a hand under the lip of the hull, lifting the fibreglass boat easily.
'We could use these. Be much quicker way of getting across the swamp.'
In the black swamp water behind Radek, there is the half submerged head of a huge alligator. Its armoured skin is black. Obsidian. Reflective. And it has strange eyes. Red pupils that bleed into yellow, like diffusing saffron.
Oblivious, Radek turns back to you and Dr Ventress.
'Shall we see if they still float?'
The alligator thrusts out of the water and lunges at Radek. Massive jaws pulling open.
'Radek!'
Radek reacts and sees the gaping mouth and teeth as they lunge towards her. She turns away - just as the creature's jaws snap, closing on her backpack. Radek's screams are abruptly knocked out of her as the alligator viciously snaps its head to the side, tossing the young woman like a ragdoll. Radek remains held fast by the shoulder straps on her bag. Then - the alligator pulls back into the water, and both the creature and Radek are gone.
A moment of stunned silence.
You run for the water. 'RADEK!'
You're up to your knees in the swamp, gun raised, sweeping the black mirrored surface.
Thorensen and Sheppard appear from the hut.
'What the hell happened?'
'A gator took her! We've got to-'
At that moment, Radek bursts out of the water, only a couple of metres from you. Her backpack is gone. She's gasping for breath.
'Help! HELP ME!'
You grab her and start dragging her out of the swamp.
'It's got my bag!'
'Fuck the bag!'
Just as the both of you reach the bank - the water erupts behind you as the gator appears and lunges again. You shove Radek hard to the side, and pull your rifle to your shoulder, opening fire. You empty an entire clip into the gator. Rounds slam into torso, punching through the reptile armour. But incredibly, the creature isn't killed. It simply redirects its attention from Radek to you. You desperately try to jam in a new clip as the gator propels itself in your direction. Just as the creature is about to reach you, the clip is driven home, and you cock your gun and open fire again - emptying this magazine at point blank range, directly down the gator's throat. The muzzle flash illuminates the interior. Bullets slam into the flesh. This time, you are joined by Sheppard, Thorensen, Dr Ventress and Radek.
In five seconds, five women empty five magazines. Riddling the creature's head and torso. After the last shot is fired, the alligator remains supported on its legs, jaws open, frozen for a moment, half out of the water. Then the legs buckle. And the jaws shut. It's dead.

SWAMP - DAY
Radek is still panting. 'Be careful! There might be a reflex!'
Sheppard and Thorensen start to prize the jaws open. 'I think its reflex days are behind it.'
You peer in to see jagged stalagmite teeth and a slab of tongue.
'It's the exactly same as the flowers.'
Behind the row of teeth, there is a second row. Internal, folded backward slightly. And behind the second row, there is third, these almost flat.
'Look at the teeth. Concentric rows. Something here is making big waves in the gene pool.'
Sheppard strains. 'Sharks have teeth like that.'
Dr Ventress stands behind you, observing. 'Could it be a cross-breed?'
'You can't cross-breed different species. They have different genes.'
You retract your head. The jaw shuts with a wet thump.
'We should get back to the boats.'
There are only two boats, the first large enough to hold 4 people, and the other, 2.

DR VENTRESS, RADEK AND THORENSEN TAKE THE FIRST BOAT. YOU AND SHEPPARD TAKE THE OTHER.
The flat-bottomed boats glide over black water, swampland floating by. Serene. While Sheppard paddles, you notice a mark on your forearm. It looks like a faint bruise. You push at it with your thumb, vaguely puzzled about where you picked it up.
'You hurt, Kerans?'
'Just a bruise. Guess I picked it up with that gator.
'Likely,' Sheppard pauses, 'so where did you learn to shoot?'
You look away and prepare to get your internal story straight.
'My husband was military. We used to go hunting together in Pennsylvania. Deer.'
'Was military.'
'Yeah.'
'He quit?'
'... No.'
You hesitate. You don't want to lie to Sheppard - but do it anyway.
'KIA.' It's almost the truth.
'I'm sorry to hear that.'
'But I guess there had to be something.'
'What do you mean?'
'Signing up for something like this - it's not something you do if your life is in perfect harmony.'
She nods towards the other boat.
'We're all damaged goods here. Thorensen is teetotal, therefore an addict. And Radek won't wear short sleeves because she doesn't want you to see the pale scars on her forearms.
'Ventress?'
'She's like an office building in a financial district. All steel and glass and height. But what for?'
'You?'
Sheppard pauses.
'I lost someone. Like you. But, a daughter. Leukemia.'
Silence.
'Thorensen called this a suicide mission.'
'When you volunteered, did you have high expectations of making it back?'

The flat-bottomed boats glide over black water, swampland floating by. Serene. While Thorensen paddles, almost absently, your hand goes to your neck, and your fingers lightly touch the silver locket that hangs from the slender chain.
'Hey.'
You look up, snapping back to focus and closing the locket with a soft snap, before Thorensen can see the image inside.
'... Oh, hey.'
'Wasn't meaning to pry.'
'No - it's just-'
Thorensen holds up a hand. 'It's cool. No need to explain. I just saw you zoning out, and...' Thorensen shrugs. '... I don't know. I was thinking how you ended up here.'

THORENSEN, RADEK AND SHEPPARD TAKE THE FIRST BOAT. YOU AND DR VENTRESS TAKE THE OTHER.
The flat-bottomed boats glide over black water, swampland floating by. Serene. You feel Dr Ventress's gaze on you as you paddle.
'You're upset.'
'The previous expeditions. Were they selected in the same way as this one? From volunteers.'
'Yes. They were.'
'Even the soldiers?'
'... No one was ordered to go.'
You slow your paddle. 'Then I have to ask: why did my husband volunteer for a suicide mission?'
Dr Ventress pauses.
'Why would I have an answer to that question?'
'Because you ran the programme. You must have assessed him. And he must have told you.'
'So you're asking me as a psychologist?'
'Yes.'
'Then, as a psychologist, I think you're confusing suicide with self-destruction, and they're very different. Almost none of us commit suicide, whereas almost all of us self-destruct. Somehow. In some part of our lives. We drink, or take drugs, or destabilise the happy job - or happy marriage.'
You are uncertain whether this was targeted at you.
Dr Ventress continues. 
'But these aren't decisions. They're impulses. And in fact, as a biologist, you're better placed to explain them than me.'
'What do you mean?'
'Isn't the self-destruction coded into us? Imprinted into each cell.'
Silence.
Dr Ventress shrugs.

DR VENTRESS, THORENSEN AND SHEPPARD TAKE THE FIRST BOAT. YOU AND RADEK TAKE THE OTHER.
The flat-bottomed boats glide over black water, swampland floating by. Serene. While you paddle, Radek runs her fingers through the water. The sleeve of her hoodie gets wet, but she doesn't roll it up.
'You seem to like this place.'
'It's beautiful. But also terrifying,' Radek pulls her hand back, 'I sometimes wish I had someone, or something on the outside to go back to.'
Almost absently, your hand goes to your neck, and your fingers lightly touch the silver locket that hangs from the slender chain. 'Even if you know you're going to lose it?'
Radek frowns. Then realizing what you were saying, she asks, 'A lover?'
You nod. 'He's…dying. We don't know why. Radiation. A virus of some sort.'

ABANDONED BASE - DAY
Thorensen's eyes narrow. 'We got something here.'
The two boats glide towards a shoreline. Behind which, there is a cluster of low concrete buildings. 
You walk into the collection of buildings.
They have a distinctively military feel. Prefab huts, breeze block walls, chain-link fences, guard huts by the gate. Nature has been busy reclaiming the area. Tall grasses push through cracks in the tarmac. The concrete is stained with rain and dark algae. And as with the trees in the swamp, brightly-coloured mosses bloom on the buildings. Dr Ventress notices your gaze going to her.
'More mutations.'
'I saw many on the trees. They're everywhere.'
'They look malignant, don't you think? Like tumours.'
You don't answer.
Dr Ventress addresses the group.
'At least now we know where we are. This was the previous Southern Reach headquarters, before the Shimmer swallowed it.'
Sheppard pulls her map out and scans it.
'Yes. I've got it. Right here.'
RADEK exhales. 'Awesome. We're not lost anymore.'
Thorensen looks around.
'And it's nice timing. A pretty good place for us to stay the night.'
'Agreed.'
Dr Ventress points to a low building up ahead. 'That used to be the barracks. We'll billet in there.'

ABANDONED BASE/BARRACKS - DAY
The door to the barracks dormitory opens, and you enter. Light pushes through the grimy windows, and the foliage that has grown up outside. It illuminates rows of beds with bare mattresses. Thorensen pulls off her bag and drops it on the nearest one.
You take a couple of steps further into the room. You see something, a couple of beds further into the barracks. There's something lying on the ground. When you get closer, you see it's someone's backpack. And you recognise what kind of someone. Khaki. Military. Spec ops.
'Uh - guys. Come and look at this.'
The others join you.
'... Whoa. Someone else is here?'
'Was here. It's covered in dust.'
'You think one of the other missions?
'Certainly could be. No reason to assume they weren't able to reach as far as us.'
You open the bag and start pulling things out. A washbag. A scrunched-up rain poncho. Then - a video camera. You glance back at the others.
'What are you waiting for? Do it!'
You pop open the flip screen and press the play button.
... And the camera is stone dead.
'Figures.'
Radek grabs her camera. 'No problem. Just take out the memory card and we'll stick it in my camera.'

ABANDONED BASE/BARRACKS - DAY
Radek clips shut the card hatch, and powers the camera up. 'There we go.'
The video starts.
At first, abstract. Something dark and unfocused, accompanied by the kind of noise you hear when someone accidentally dials their phone from their pocket. Then the image and noise suddenly resolve. 
A shirtless man is sat on a chair. His name is Mayer, and a couple of soldiers stand beside him. Holding him. 
'Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.' You freeze at the sight of Kane.
'Okay,' Mayer nods. He's terrified.
Kane reaches to his belt and pulls a long fixed-blade knife. Slowly, carefully, he presses his knife into the flesh, cutting across and down Mayer's abdomen in straight lines. Dark red blood oozes from the incision. Mayer starts panting. 
'Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.'
'Hold him. Hold him down.'
Kane grips the flap of skin and lifts it slowly – to reveal Mayer's intestines squirming, writhing, fusing together into a hideous chimera of man and eel.
The image dies.

ABANDONED BASE/BARRACKS - DAY
'... Oh God.' Radek is in a place beyond horror - mind assailed, not able to process what has just happened.
You  break the spell by leaning forward and gently taking the camera from her hands. Sheppard and Thorensen walk backwards a few steps, still in a state of shock. 
You play the next video.
You find yourself looking at Kane again.
'I don't know how long we've been here. It must at least be weeks. But it could also be months, or years.'
Kane is sitting on steps, in sunlight. Somewhere in the abandoned base. Red eyes, unshaven. Wired. As if he hasn't slept in days. He's looking just past the lens - addressing not the camera, but the cameraman.
'We've lost track. Of time, and everything else. Sometimes I think I must be dreaming. But I know I can't be. Because I never wake up.'
A pause.
'If anything, it's the other life that feels most like a dream. The wife. The home. They don't seem to –' Kane breaks off and glances over his shoulder.
'You hear that?'
There is a distant crackle of automatic gunfire.
Kane looks back at the cameraman. 'They're coming back.'
He stands abruptly. Out of frame. 
'Get to positions.'
The video jerks sideways as the cameraman moves, then cuts to black.

'There was something alive inside that man.'
'No. That was a trick of the light.'
'His insides were moving.'
'No, it was shock. Radek, that was a shock response.'
'Watch it again.'
'No, I'm not gonna fucking watch it again!' Thorensen walks off in angry silence.
'You know them, right?'
For a moment, you think Sheppard is talking to you. Then you see her directing the question at Dr Ventress.
'It's the team that went in the year before us. The spec ops guys.'
Dr Ventress sighs. 'Yes.'
Then Sheppard starts walking. In the same direction you saw Thorensen walk. Down the length of the barracks, to the pool. After a few moments, the others go after her - except you.
Halfway down the barracks, Dr Ventress stops. She looks back at you. A pause. Then you follow.

ABANDONED BASE/POOL - DAY
You enter, to find Radek, Sheppard, Thorensen and Dr Ventress standing in front of a body. Mayer's body, plastered to the wall. Desiccated, skeletal. His ribs have been broken open at the sternum, and are splayed open like a book. Like inverted wings. His body seems to be enmeshed with plant matter - roots and thorns  push outwards, bristling over the crown of his skull and along the walls.
Radek panics. '... I don't want to stay here tonight.'
No one says anything.
'I don't want to stay here tonight!'
'I don't think we have a choice. It's late in the day for us to move on.'
'Please–'
'Hey,' Sheppard puts a hand on Radek's face, gently redirecting the woman's gaze away from the corpse, 'we won't have to stay in the barracks. We can choose another building. And we'll figure out a guard rota.'

ABANDONED BASE/REC ROOM - NIGHT
There's a dart board on the wall, and a pool table with mould covered baize, and a pinball machine with broken glass.
On the floor, Thorensen is asleep on her unrolled bedding. Beside Thorensen is Radek, also asleep. Beside Radek is Sheppard. Awake. Sheppard winks.
'Hey.'
'How you holding up?'
'... Fine.'
You nod at Radek. 'Good she's getting some rest.'
'Yeah - with the help of a little sedative.'
'How about you? Get any sleep?'
Sheppard shakes her head. 'I'd need a horse-tranq to knock me out. I'm at least as freaked as Radek. Just hiding it better.'
You look down at your arm, where the unexplained bruise you first noticed after the gator incident has now resolved into a dark circle.

YOU EXIT THE REC ROOM HUT.
The hut is on the edge of the abandoned facility. The starlight doesn't illuminate much, but you can just about make out the chain-link perimeter fence, and beyond it, the black shape of the forest.
Dr Ventress is sitting at a picnic table, just outside the door, studying a map by torchlight.
'What are you doing up, Kerans? You're not due to relieve me until three am.'
'I'm done sleeping for the night.'
'In that case, you might as well take a look at this.' 
Dr Ventress taps way-point positions on the map. 'Here's us. Here's where I think we camped last night. And here's the lighthouse. Judging by the distance we covered today, we won't reach it tomorrow. But look, southwest from here-' 
Dr Ventress indicates a new position. 
'- Ville Perdu. A tiny community, evacuated ten years ago. I think we should aim there for tomorrow night. Then pick up the road to the coast.
You say nothing.
Dr Ventress notices the non-response. She looks up at you from the map and the torchlight.
'You shouldn't worry.'
'... Worry about what?'
'Your secret. It's safe with me.'
You pause.
“'My secret'. You're talking about my husband?”
You lower your voice. 'Is that not our secret? In that you were the one who instructed me to keep it.'
Dr Ventress shrugs. 'By all means. If that way of seeing it is helpful to you.'

YOU EXIT THE REC ROOM HUT.
The room is lit by your upended flashlight.
Opening your backpack, you remove a small case. A field microscope. A scalpel. You remove a blade from a sealed foil packet and clip a blade into the scalpel.
The mark is now darker. And larger. Roughly circular, with a slight indication of a pattern. It's as if the bruise was painted with ink on wet paper, and the marks have blurred into something too abstract to understand.
You gaze at the strange, oddly malign shape. Then you push the scalpel into it, drawing blood from the dark marks.
The sight of the crimson bead hypnotises you.
You lean over the microscope.
The biconcave shape is clearly visible. But inside the translucent cell structure...something is shimmering.
You lean away from the microscope.
Then you stand, walking past the sleeping figures of Radek and Thorensen into the kitchen. And – quietly, with a minimum of fuss – you throw up. When you have finished, you turn around – and see Sheppard, standing at the kitchen door. Looking at you.
'Is it in you too?'

THE WORD HANGS.
And you are spared having to find a reply - by a strange noise, from somewhere in the darkness.
A popping. A tearing. Not organic. Metallic. Surprisingly loud. 
The both of you flick round to the source of the noise.
'…What was that?'
'I don't know.'
You unsling your rifle and raise it, switching on the night-vision scope. You scan the tree line, through the fence.
'You see anything?'
'No, just –' You break off. 'Yes.'
Through the scope, there is something. A large hole in the perimeter fence. The chain-link is twisted, pulled open.
'Something's just come through the fence. It's ripped open like a zipper.'
'But what could do that?'
'I don't know. Something big.'
Another noise. And this is organic. It's a thump of movement. Then a panting breath. A snort. And it feels very close.
You all freeze.
Then Sheppard lifts her flashlight, pointing it straight in front of her. It illuminates a huge creature…less than two metres away.
It looks something like a black bear. But like the gator, it's twice the size it should be. And it's stranger than the gator. The bear is emaciated and skinny, its skin malnourished and blistered. A human skull is fused into the side of its head, where the flesh has been peeled away.
And it's up on its hind legs. Standing like a man, towering over you and Sheppard, blotting out the stars.
Then it opens its jaws. You see human teeth pushing outwards.
'...shit.'
The next moment - with shocking speed - the bear lunges downwards - at Sheppard.
There is a glimpse of her being pulled to the side, and almost compressed.
Then the flashlight winks out.
And Sheppard is gone. Sucked into a rush of movement and blackness.
'Sheppard!'
No answer.
Thorensen and Radek appear at the door to the rec room hut.
You clamp the night scope to your eye, scanning desperately. Something massive in the darkness is moving fast, back towards the fence. A glimpse of Sheppard, dragged like a rag doll.
Then it's gone. The creature, and Sheppard, have vanished.
Thorensen appears, holding her gun. 'What's going on? Where is she?'
'She's gone! She was right here next to me - and something took her! It was like a bear, or –'
'HELP ME!'
It's Sheppard. But she's nowhere close. It's from the trees.
'Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Sheppard!'
The four of you start running toward the sound. You reach the break in the fence. But the forest beyond is immeasurably massive and dark, and the screams are from deep inside.
'SHEPPARD!'
Sheppard's shrieking continues. Then it abruptly stops.

ABANDONED BASE/REC ROOM - DAY
Radek is sat on the ground, shaking uncontrollably. Dr Ventress sits on a chair, on the far side of the room, observing Radek with a neutral expression.
Radek looks up. 'We have to go back. We have to go back now.'
Dr Ventress starts packing her backpack. 'We haven't reached the lighthouse. We still don't understand the cause or nature of the Shimmer.'
Thorensen is seething. 'But we have data, observations, photographs, samples –' 
'All of which make the phenomenon less explicable, not more.'
'That's beside the point! Our mission parameters are to get into Area X, find something out, and live to tell the story.'
'Mission parameters?'
Dr Ventress stands. 'I'm not sure I have any mission parameters.'
Thorensen shoots a glance at you. '... What the hell?'
'I plan to get to the lighthouse. But I'm not going to pretend it's for a mission. It's because I want to know what's inside.'
Dr Ventress walks to the door. 'I'll do it alone, if need be. You simply decide whether you're coming with me, or not.'
She exits.
Silence.
'... She's crazy.'
You finally speak. 'We should be heading back.'
Thorensen looks relieved. 'Right. Good. The three of us can –'
'Just a minute.'
Thorensen already doesn't like this.
'We head back: yes. But it took us six days to get here. The coast is only two days away. And as Sheppard pointed out: once we hit the shore, we can follow it until we hit the perimeter wall.'
'You're saying we get out by going deeper in?'
'... If you like, yes.
“If I 'like'? No Kerans, I don't fucking 'like'.”
Thorensen doesn't disguise her suspicion.
'This isn't just a way of talking us round so we keep heading for the lighthouse.'
'It has nothing to do with the lighthouse. I believe the coast is the best route out. That's all.'
Silence.
Thorensen glances at Radek.
The younger woman has closed her eyes. Just trying to block it all out.

Dr Ventress stands in the spot where Sheppard was attacked, gazing towards the broken fence.
You approach her.
'We're coming with you.'
Dr Ventress glances back at you.
'I knew you would be. But I'm glad about the others. Better we stick together.'
The four-person team walk in single file. Dr Ventress on point. Then Radek. Then Thorensen. Then you. As they walk, you become aware that Thorensen is talking to herself.
'Hey, Thorensen.'
Thorensen's gaze flicks round. There's a flash of something in her eyes. Something like anger. Something like a lack of recognition. As if whatever she's seeing at that moment, it isn't you. Then it's gone.
'What?'
'You okay?'
Thorensen turns away. 'I'm fine. Leave me alone.'
Dr Ventress suddenly stops. She's seen something just ahead. Then Radek sees it too. She puts a hand over her mouth.
As you reach them, you see a crushed undergrowth, forming a trail into the trees. And along it, unmistakable splashes and smears of blood on the leaves.
'... Sheppard.'
'Very likely.'
'She might still be alive.'
'I think it's unlikely.'

YOU COCK YOUR RIFLE.
Thorensen walks towards you. 'I'll come with you, Kerans.'
You glance at her.
Again, you see something in her eyes. A slight sheen or glaze. Something not quite right.
'I'll go alone. Quicker, quieter.'
You head through the swamp, gun raised. Following the blood trail. From somewhere nearby, you hears a noise. Perhaps the bear. Perhaps something else.
You look into the trees. There is movement in the foliage. Something could be out there - a creature, or person. Or equally it could be a trick of the light, and shadows.
You wait. But it's not the bear. It's a deer. Or a deer-like creature. Elongated legs. Branch and leaf structures flowing out of its head as antlers. Then - skittish - it's gone.
Sweat runs down your face. You blink it out of your eyes.
Silence returns.
You head on into the dense foliage.
Then you see something up ahead.
At the end of the blood trail, in a clearing, sunlit, is Sheppard. Lying on her back, facing upwards. Clothes soaked with blood.
You cautiously approach Sheppard's body, gun raised, continually scanning the tree line. As you reach Sheppard, you notice her midriff is torn. Either bitten or clawed. Through the dark congealed blood and ripped material, you glimpse the blue white coil of intestine. 
But her face is intact. There are flecks of blood on her cheek. And her eyes are open.
You return to where Dr Ventress, Thorensen and Radek are waiting.
'Did you find her?'
'She's dead.'
The finality in your voice dissuades follow-up questions.
Wordlessly, Dr Ventress, Thorensen and Radek shoulder their backpacks.

OUTSIDE VILLE PERDU - SUNDOWN
You stand on a dirt road.
Ahead is a small town. A backwater place. The twenty or so buildings are largely wooden and single-storey. Plant-life has been busy reclaiming the structures. The moss tumour-growths are even more extreme here. Some of the buildings are half-swallowed by the red and green clusters.
Dr Ventress looks around. 'This is where we camp tonight. The ocean is another two hours hike from here. We pick a house. Secure the windows and doors. And we don't venture out until sun-up.'
The four of you enter the town. Not talking. Scanning. Alert. Weapons unslung, and hands resting with the finger above the trigger guard.
You are distracted by the sight of one of the houses – from which a tree has appeared to grow from the inside. Branches push out through the windows and roof shingles.
'Kerans.' The quiet urgency in Radek's voice makes everyone look round.
Radek is frozen to the spot.
You follow her gaze - and jolt.
Twenty or so metres ahead, in the dark space between two of the buildings, there is what appears to be the silhouette of a man. Motionless. Arms at his side. Facing them.
Only after registering the shape of the man does it become clear that there is something odd about him. He's slightly misshapen. His arms and torso are too thin. His legs are too thick.
No one has moved.
You take a step towards the man and raise a hand.
'Hello?'
The silhouette of the man doesn't react at all.
You take another step - and the shift in perspective reveals another figure. This one is behind the man, behind the building. Not in shadow, but caught in the light from the dropping sun.
It looks like a child.
Also motionless, also misshapen. But now, in the light, the oddness of the shape makes more sense. The child is not flesh and blood, but plant. A twisting root system form calves and feet, leading up to knotted branches and densely packed leaves. Like a topiary.
You, followed by the others, walk through the space between the buildings, past the shape of the man - into something that is like a statue garden.
In the space between the back of the houses and the tree-line of the forest, there are twenty or so plant figures.
Some of them have grown into reasonable facsimiles of a man, or woman, or a child. Others are incomplete. The legs, and half the torso. An outstretched arm, becoming a tangle of twigs and leaves beyond the bicep. Others have exploded far beyond the basic outline of a human, expanding out into tree structures.
'What are these things? Were they made by the people who lived here?'
'Impossible. The area has been empty for years.'
'Or made by one of the previous teams?'
You examine a child plant. 'They haven't been cut this way.'
You pluck a leaf from the child figure.
'They've grown this way.'
'What are you talking about? That makes no sense.'
Radek speaks quietly. 'I think it does.'
Radek has sat on the grass between two of the figures.
'In fact, it makes total sense.'
All turn to Radek.
'I'd thought the radio waves were blocked by the Shimmer, and that's why no one inside could communicate with base or GPS.'
Radek glances upwards.
'But I look up. I see the sun. And the sky. The light waves aren't blocked.'
Bright rainbow colours fringe the clouds above.
'They're refracted.'
Radek reaches for her short-wave radio, hooked on her belt, and switches it on.
'And it's the same with the radios. The signals aren't gone...'
Through the static fuzz, there are sounds. Pulses. Soft distorted tones, that rise and fall.
'... They're split. Scrambled.'
Radek switches the radio off and shifts her gaze to you.
'The leaf in your hand. You know what you'd find if you sequenced it? Hox. Pax 6.'
Dr Ventress cuts in. 'Hox? What are you talking about?'
You show Dr Ventress the leaf. 'They're the genes that define the body plan, the physical structure. But in animals. Not plants.'
Radek continues. 'But the plants have human body plan. Arms attached to shoulders. Legs to hips.'
You try to collect your thoughts, mind racing.
'No - they're just simulacra. Like a stick insect or chameleon. What you're saying is simply not possible.'
'None of this is possible, Lena. But it's what's happening. The Shimmer is a prism. It refracts everything. Light, waves, fields, DNA.'
Radek hesitates.
'All DNA.'
Thorensen interrupts, overwhelmed by confusion and frustration.
“Stop! Just - stop talking science. Speak English. What do you mean, 'all DNA'?”
'She's talking about our DNA.'
You let the leaf drop.
'Whatever's happening to everything else will also be happening to us.'
In the low sun, everything upright is silhouette, fringed with gold.
On the ground, the long shadows of the women and the plant statues are fringed with chromatic aberration, and are indistinguishable from each other.

VILLE PERDU/HOUSE - NIGHT
The four of you are inside the front room of one of the abandoned houses. 
The kitchen and living room windows have been barricaded, and you and Thorensen are positioning a heavy dresser to jam the front door.
Once it's in place, Thorensen turns to the others.
'You all get some sleep. I'm keeping first watch.'

'You lying bitch.'
The voice intrudes in the way an alarm clock intrudes on a dream. The sudden awareness that the alarm is real, and the dream is not.
You open your eyes and see Thorensen and Radek.
Dr Ventress is nowhere to be seen.
Radek looks terrified.
And Thorensen is leaning over you. Eyes wide, lips curled back over teeth. She's holding her automatic rifle. Pointed at your head.
You startle - waking fast. Sitting upright.
'... What's going on?'
'You don't get to ask that question. You get to answer it.'
Radek tosses something. It lands on your lap.
You look down - and see Kane's face, looking at you out of your open locket.
Your blood freezes.
You look up - just in time to see Thorensen spin her rifle around, and smash the stock down. Knocking you out cold.

VILLE PERDU/HOUSE/FRONT ROOM – NIGHT
You wake to see the view-finder of a camera, as it powers up.
The camera is mounted on a tripod, and is filming you, Dr Ventress and Radek -  who are all gagged and tied to kitchen chairs. Wrists bound behind your backs. Ankles tied to the chair legs.
Blood runs down your face from a cut inside your hairline.
Thorensen stands in front of you, holding your open locket.
She turns to Dr Ventress. 'You knew, obviously.'
Then she looks at Radek. 'Did you know?'
Radek shakes her head. Her breath is quavering.
'Okay.'
A short pause.
'Theory one: something in here killed them. Two…is that they went crazy and they killed each other. Josie was attacked by an alligator, and Cass did get killed by a bear.'
Thorensen's voice breaks towards the end.
'So yes, theory one, it fits.'
'But…I didn't actually see a bear. And neither did Josie. The only people who saw the bear were Lena and Ventress.'
Dr Ventress grunts.
'So nothing's confirmed. Everything's on their word. Everything's on Lena's word.'
'And what we know now, what we know, is that Lena…is a liar.'
Dr Ventress tries to speak through the gag, her voice muffled and indistinct.
Thorensen turns immediately to Dr Ventress. 'Shut the fuck up!'
She turns back to you. 'Lena, you're a liar. Did you kill Cass?'
You shake your head violently.
'Did you lose your shit?'
Silence.
'Or do you think I've lost my shit and we're gonna fuck each other up? That's theory two.'
Then Thorensen sinks slowly to the floor, smoothing back her hair with her fingertips. 'Oh god.'
'When I look at my hands, and my fingerprints…I can see them moving. If I let you go, and you tie me to a chair and cut me open…are my insides gonna move like my fingerprints?'
Thorensen starts panting. Then she exhales deeply.
'But I'm not the one tied to a chair.'
Thorensen stands up and walks toward you, holding a knife. 'You are.'
At that moment, Thorensen is interrupted by the sound of screaming. It's a woman. Coming from somewhere outside.
And you've heard it before. It's the sound Sheppard made as she was being killed in the forest.
The screams fade out.
A beat of stunned silence in the room.
Broken by Thorensen.
'Cass?'
The knife clatters to the floor.
'You said she was dead.'
Another sudden burst of screaming. This time, it sounds much closer, and within it, you can hear words.
'Help me - please help me -'
It cuts out again.
Thorensen grabs her gun. Starts for the door. 'Cass! Cass, I'm coming!'
You and Dr Ventress struggle against the bindings.
Radek is frozen, staring at the door - as you hear Thorensen start pushing back the dresser that barricades it.
You get the gag off, and fight desperately against the ropes around your wrists - but too late.
Thorensen has pulled the dresser back, and the door is open.
BANG.
All jump.
All heads turn to the sound of the noise.
It reveals the huge bear-creature that killed Sheppard. Eyes reflecting light from the room as bright yellow discs. Oddly elongated claws, like long hooks of a sloth.
The bear walks into the room slowly, sniffing the air. Its mouth is open wide. Drool drips from one sharp fang, and blood rims its gums. The floorboards creak beneath its weight.
Your backs are turned to the creature, but it's now inches away from you and Radek. It sniffs the air again. Then it opens its jaws, as if to howl. But instead, it emits Sheppard's high, desperate scream.
'HELP! HELP ME!'
Radek is beginning to hyperventilate.
'Don't react.' Your voice shakes.
The bear turns to look at Radek - and sinks its fangs into her shoulder.
Her screams are muffled by the gag.
A split second later, Thorensen is at the doorway. Impaled, but alive. She fires a quick burst into the bear. It immediately swings in her direction. Charging her.
The women are knocked violently aside.
Radek's chair breaks as she lands - allowing her to kick out of the ropes that tie her ankles. She scrambles across the floor as the bear reels back. And lunges down.
Where Thorensen's jaw should be, there is a cavity, as if her mouth has swallowed the lower part of her face.
Radek reaches for Thorensen's knife on the floor. Grabbing it and slicing through the rope tying her hands.
Then the bear seems to looks right at you. Hands and ankles still tied to the chair. You cry out as it strikes your side, its face close enough to smell its horrid breath.
Then Radek opens fire with the automatic rifle. Emptying the entire clip into the bear's freakishly deformed head.
For a moment it remains upright.
'Help…me-'
Then it topples like a felled tree.

She stops for a moment and looks up. 
'We are disintegrating. Our bodies as fast as our minds. Can you feel it? It's like the onset of dementia.'
Radek glances at you.
'If I don't reach the lighthouse soon, the person that started this journey won't be the person to end it. I want to be the one who ends it.'

VILLE PERDU/GARDEN - DAY
Sunlight in the statue garden.
A few beats of quiet.
Radek is kneeling, her eyes closed. For once, shes not wearing her hoodie.
'We should go, Josie.'
'How long was your husband in the Shimmer?'
'It's hard to say exactly. Theoretically, as long as a year.'
'That's a long time to be inside and remain intact.'
'I'm not so sure he was intact.'
'It was so strange, hearing Sheppard's voice in the mouth of that creature last night. I think as she was dying, part of her mind became part of the creature that was killing her.'
A pause.
'It's a terrible thought. Imagine being frightened and in pain, and having that as the only part of you which survives. I wouldn't like that at all.'
Radek touches the leaves that have sprouted from her skin. In the moment, it seems as if she is submitting to the strange gravity of the Shimmer, letting it transform her.
She stands up and walks further into the statue garden, flowers literally blooming from her self-inflicted scars. Then she stops and turns to face you.
'Ventress wants to face it. You want to fight it. But I don't think I want either of those things.'
Radek continues walking ahead.
'Josie.'
You follow her into the statue garden.
'Josie!'
You look out at the foliate people. She's gone.

BEACH - DAY
It doesn't take you long to reach the coast. 
A long hook of beach, where the swamp gives way to the sea.
Massively empty. Miles of undulating dunes, and the great flat ocean.
Along the beach, strange shapes rise. Visually similar to the tumour-like growths on the plants and buildings, but these are made of sand. Like massive termite mounds, as much as thirty foot high, morphed into spires and oddly organic abstractions.
Only one other landmark can be seen. A couple of miles distant, seen through a blue haze of air and sea spray. 
The lighthouse.
Slender, tall. And white - where one can still see of the original construction, behind the brightly coloured moss.
Leading that direction, a snaking line of footprints are clearly visible in the damp sand.
The trail left by Dr Ventress.

Page 52
LIGHTHOUSE - DAY
You enter the base of the lighthouse.
Light filters down from the window, thirty metres above. It illuminates a round room, with some specific features.
A wooden staircase winds up the circular wall to the top of the structure.
Abandoned on the floor, there is some military gear. A backpack, surrounded by cannister-shaped grenades, and a rifle.
Opposite where you stand, there is a tunnel in the floor, about two metres in diameter. At its entrance, the wooden boards have been pulled up, and laid out as a kind of ramp structure, leading downwards.
Inside the tunnel something glows. The soft blue-green light of phosphorescence.
Finally, in the middle of the room there is a video camera on a tripod. The camera faces a skeleton, sitting propped against the wall. A black scorch mark surrounds it, rising up the curved wall.
You take this all in.
Your gaze finally settles on the camera. You reach out to grasp the camera in your hands.
The video starts.
You see Kane entering the lighthouse. He slips off his backpack. Lays down his rifle.
The camera position is locked-off, on a tripod, in the middle of the room.
It faces Kane.
Kane is sat on the floor, cross-legged, with his back to the curved wall. Holding something in his hands.
'I thought I was a man.'
Kane scoffs.
'I had a life. People called me Kane. But now I'm not so sure.'
'If I wasn't Kane, what was I?'
Kane looks at the cameraman.
'Was I you? Were you me?'
The cameraman doesn't answer.
'My flesh moves like liquid. My mind is…just cut loose.'
He looks down at the ground. 'I can't bear it.'
He opens his palm. He's holding one of the cannister-shaped grenades.
He glances up at the cameraman.
'You ever seen a phosphorous grenade go off? They're kind of bright. Shield your eyes.'
Kane hesitates.
'If you ever get out of here, find Lena.'
'I will.'
Kane pulls the pin on the grenade.
There is a soft quick ticking, like a wristwatch by your ear.
Kane gazes directly at the camera. Unafraid.
'Five, four, three, two-'
The next moment - the grenade detonates.
A blinding white flame, as if Kane is suddenly holding the sun in his lap. A high pressure rush of noise.
Initially, you can barely see Kane's shape through the glow.
Then it dims slightly, starting to burn itself out.
A couple of moments pass.
The flare continues to die down.
Then - the cameraman walks forward. Stepping into frame.
His back is to us.
He gazes at the hunched charcoal figure, as it continues to blaze with the fierce white light.
Then he turns his head. And in the etched light of the phosphorous, we see his face.
It's Kane.
On this - the image freezes.
'Oh god. Oh my god. No.'
Your hands are shaking. You shut the camera. 
'No, no, no...'
You are interrupted by a sound.
A distorted scream. Echoed and distant, as if having passed through passages and chambers.
Female. Dr Ventress.
It's coming from the torn up floorboards. The tunnel, that leads down into bedrock. You look to where the floorboards have been pulled up. To the tunnel entrance, and the soft blue-green light.
You control your fear. Knuckles white around the grip of your rifle.
Then you make your way down the tunnel, gun raised.
The walls continue the curve of the lighthouse above, and the floor is sloping downwards - which means the passage is corkscrewing into the ground.
It is unclear how the rock has been cleared. The walls, ceiling, and floor are made of smooth black rock, like obsidian.
The rock is rippled, as if worn smooth by an ancient stream or lava flow.
It is seamed with phosphorescence - illuminating everything in the way that sea creatures light their way in the depths.
And the walls seem to be moving. Or gently undulating.
The surface of the walls are covered in cilia. Tiny anemone arms waving, caught in the flow of slow-moving water. As if what lies inside is feeding on what lies outside, and being channelled along a vein and capillary structure.
Then the tunnel suddenly stops, and opens out into a chamber.
Choices:
1. None > 53

Page 53
UNDER THE LIGHTHOUSE/CHAMBER - DAY
The chamber is roughly semi-spherical. Three quarters of a sphere, with the bottom levelled out into a floor.
Either side of these points, the walls are glassy smooth. The arrangement is similar to petals, as if we are on the inside of flower before it has unfurled. The interior of a vast lotus bulb.
The very center of the chamber is particularly bright - because it is to here that the phosphorescent veins and channels all lead.
And standing on this brightest point - is Dr Ventress.
The doctor is internally lit. Cilia cover her skin like undulating fur. She shimmers gently.
'… Dr Ventress?
Dr Ventress turns to you.
She has the same expression as Kane when he appeared back home. Alzheimer's-like. In her eyes there is confusion.
'It's the last phase. Vanished into havoc.'
'Unfathomable mind…'
She inhales deeply.
'…and now beacon. Now sea.'
'Dr Ventress.'
'I had to know what it was. What was waiting. I had to know. And now it's inside me.'
'... What's inside you?'
'It's not like us. It's unlike us. I don't know what it wants. Or if it wants. But it will grow…until it encompasses everything. Our bodies and our minds will be fragmented into their smallest parts until…not one part remains. Annihilation.'
Then something disturbing begins to happen to Dr Ventress.
Splits, complex fissures, start rippling across her skin. As if her form is becoming unbalanced. Then Dr Ventress can't speak any more. She starts to transform, a shape-shift of a kind that your mind cannot entirely make sense of - like a vector cube that unfolds and refolds from within itself, its interior indefinably becoming its exterior.
In this case - it is the doctor's skin that is unfolding and refolding.
Her face splits open like a starfish. From out of the starfish, multiple circles of radiating objects emerge. Gold orbs, each with unique radiating Mandelbrot-like ferns.
The rainbow ferns radiate ever-increasing size and complexity.
The concentric circles are endless.
The sense of expansion becomes vast.
Until the mesh of immense structural detail becomes the mesh of undulating cilia on skin.
But Dr Ventress is gone.
Where she stood, there is a shape.
A being.
An uncoalescing, fracturing form. Made of light, and ice, liquid. Endless refractions.
A drop of your blood falls into it. 
Then it expands. Transforms. And resolves - into a humanoid figure.
Sexless. Featureless. Having the arms, legs, head and torso of a human - man or woman. But nothing else.
No eyes, or mouth, or nose, or muscle form.

YOU SQUEEZE THE TRIGGER.
Bullets slam into the being.
The rounds have an amazing effect.
Where they hit the body, a hole expands, like a bullet into ballistic gelatine - but does not contract.
Where they penetrate the body, they leave bright trails of emerald light, like sunlight through dust motes.
Your weapon is out. You have no more clips.

Page 55
YOU START TO RUN.
The humanoid observes you run.
Then it starts to follow you.
The first step is slow.
The second faster.
The third is as fluid and powerful as you. It starts sprinting.
You sprint back up the tunnel.
Stumbling over the shifting melded shapes.
Crashing to the ground.
Scrambling back up.
You look back. The humanoid is in pursuit.
But you see something strange happen.
Where you fell and tripped - the humanoid does exactly the same thing. Falling in the same place. In the same way. A simulacrum of your action.
You climb back up into the base of the lighthouse, but you find yourself trapped.
The humanoid simply appears in front of you. It is unclear how it got there.
The two of you begin to circle each other, until you are standing in front of the tripod.
Then you pick up the tripod and swing it like a club, smashing the camera against the humanoid's head.
A moment later, in a mirror of your actions - the humanoid strikes you back - but with incredible power.
You collapse to the ground, unable to get back up.
The humanoid is watching you. Then it lays down beside you.
When you try to get up, you notice the humanoid doing the same. And then you're staring right at it. You gasp, scrambling across the room - towards the door to the lighthouse. You open the door, but you don't make it. The humanoid has pinned you against the door.
You curl your arm at your side, pushing back hard.
It doesn't budge.
You can't breathe. The room begins to spin and collapse. Pinpoints of light burst in your eyes.
Then, like a dance, you relax, and let yourself be held by the being. Peeling away from the door. 
You move, this time towards Kane's backpack.
The humanoid is again on you.
Standing directly in front of you. Featureless, eyeless, but somehow watching.
Another pause.
Slowly, you reach down.
Opposite you, in a slightly delayed mirror action - the being does the same.
Your hand closes around one of the metal cannisters.
It does the same.
You rise again. Never taking her eyes off its face.
It rises.
You hold the cannister out towards it.
It mirrors.
You link your hands together, placing the cannister in its palm - and pull the pin.
Soft ticking from the cannisters.
The being's features start to morph - into yours. A literal mirror image. Down to the finest detail. Your stances mirror each other. Dressed identically. Smeared with blood identically.
Seconds passing.
Five, four, three, two -
You run for the door.
Its head turns, sees - but it's too late to fully react.
The phosphorous grenade detonates.
The interior of the lighthouse is suddenly illuminated by stark white light.
As you walk away from the lighthouse, long flames curl from the top window, into a plume of dark smoke.
The sun is setting, and is clustered with the psychedelic colour refractions you always see through the Shimmer.
Except that something is clearly happening.
The movements and vibrations of the Shimmer are settling.
And the colours are becoming less intense.
Then all along the beach, the sand structures start collapsing. First one, then three, then seven. Then all together.
Wind collects them as they fall.

SOUTHERN REACH FACILITY/MEDICAL WARD – NIGHT
You arrive back at the medical ward, a doctor and two spec ops soldiers walking alongside you.
'It was miraculous. It happened the same night that the Shimmer disappeared. His blood pressure stabilised, and his pulse rate started to rise. By the next morning, he was not only awake. He was lucid. Coherent.'
You reach a door in the ward.
Through the glass panel, you can see Kane inside.
Sitting at a chair. Gazing out of the window.
The doctor continues. 'There's no trace of abnormality anywhere in his system.'
You enter and close the door behind you.
Kane looks round, and you lock eyes.
Neither speak.
After a moment, you go to the window. You look out at the night sky. You see a shooting star.
Then another.
Then another.
'Are you Kane?'
Silence.
Then Kane gives a slight shake of the head.
'I don't know.'
A pause.
'Are you Lena?'
A hunk of rock burns as it falls through Earth's atmosphere.
And as the nearest meteor splits apart, you see in its core.
Something shimmering.
