## About The Project :eyes:

You play as Lena, cellular biology professor and former U.S. Army soldier. Near the US government's Area X facility lies the Shimmer, which emerged three years ago when a meteor  landed in a lighthouse nearby, and is gradually expanding and increasing its boundaries. Many expeditions have been organized, but only your husband Kane returns home after a year of absence. Kane is glazed and distant, and his condition quickly deteriorates. As Kane is put in intensive care, psychologist Dr. Ventress prepares a new expedition into the Shimmer, which you volunteer for. Three other women participate in the expedition: physicist Josie Radek, geomorphologist Cassie "Cass" Sheppard, and paramedic Anya Thorensen.
